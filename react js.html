      <b>React</b> (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
      front-end JavaScript library that aims to make building user interfaces
      based on components more "seamless".It is maintained by Meta (formerly
      Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React
      can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered
      applications with frameworks like Next.js and Remix. Because React is only
      concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM,
      React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other
      client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only
      re-renders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary
      re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.
