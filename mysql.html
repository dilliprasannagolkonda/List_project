     <b>MySQL</b>   is an open-source relational database
      management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the
      name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My, and "SQL", the
      acronym for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes
      data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each
      other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language that
      programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational
      database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to
      relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating
      system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system,
      manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database
      integrity and creation of backups.
