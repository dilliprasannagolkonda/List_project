      <b>Java</b> is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented
      programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run
      anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
      platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java
      applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
      virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
      The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level
      facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic
      capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are
      typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
