      <b>JavaScript</b>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
      language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      CSS. Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
      webpage behavior. The most popular runtime system for non-browser
      usage is Node.js. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled
      language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic
      typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It
      is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
      programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
      working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
      and the Document Object Model (DOM).
