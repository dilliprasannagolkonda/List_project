      <b>PHP</b> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web
      development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer
      Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995. The PHP reference
      implementation is now produced by the PHP Group. PHP was originally an
      abbreviation of Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the
      recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP code is usually
      processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a
      daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.
