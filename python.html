      <b>Python</b> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design
      philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant
      indentation.[33] Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.
      It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured
      (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It
      is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its
      comprehensive standard library.
